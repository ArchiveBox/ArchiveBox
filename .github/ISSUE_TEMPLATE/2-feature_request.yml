      label: "What is your proposed solution?"
      description: |
        Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I specifically need a new archive method to look for multilingual subtitle files related to pages.  
        The bigger picture solution is the ability for custom user scripts to be run in a puppeteer context during archiving.

        e.g. I wait for archivebox to finish archiving the page, then I manually run `yt-dlp --subs <URL>` inside 
        the `data/archive/<timestamp>/` directory to download the subtitle files and add them to the snapshot folder.

        DO NOT JUST ENTER "the latest verion" OR YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED.  
        We need to know what version of ArchiveBox and what feature flags you're currently running with in order to contextualize your feature request.  
        Sometimes we've already fixed the issues in newer BETA versions, sometimes features already exist but may not be available in your specific environment.
          
        Run the `archivebox version` command inside your current collection dir and paste the *full output* here (*not just the version number*).  
        For Docker Compose run: `docker compose run archivebox version`  
        For plain Docker run:   `docker run -v $PWD:/data archivebox/archivebox version`
