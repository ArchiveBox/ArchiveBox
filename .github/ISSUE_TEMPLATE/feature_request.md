## Type 

 - [ ] General Question or Disussion
 - [ ] Propose a brand new feature
 - [ ] Request modification of existing behavior or design

## What is the problem that your feature request solves
e.g. I need to be able to archive spanish and french subtitle files  
from a particular <example.com> movie site that's going down soon.

## Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes
e.g.  I specifically need a new archive method to look for multilingual subtitle files related to pages.  
The bigger picture solution is the ability for custom user scripts to be run in a puppeteer context during archiving.

## What hacks or alternative solutions have you tried to solve the problem?
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

## How badly do you want this new feature?

 - [ ] It's an urgent deal-breaker, I cant live without it
 - [ ] It's important to add it in the near-mid term future
 - [ ] It would be nice to have eventually
